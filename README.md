Smart Parking App

A mobile app prototype designed for intelligent parking management, built with React Native and Firebase Realtime Database.

This project is part of my final year project, aiming to demonstrate a real-time parking system with car park status monitoring, user registration, parking records, and automated fee calculation. It lays the foundation for future integration with ANPR and parking space detection models.

Features

- User Registration (name, phone, email, license plate)
- Car Park View (real-time parking space status with visual display)
- Simulated Entry & Exit (press buttons to simulate vehicle actions)
- Auto Duration & Fee Calculation
- One-Tap Payment Simulation
- History Record View (see all past parking logs)
- Realtime Firebase Sync with clean data structure
